*Run complex projects. Miss nothing.*

Project Vault is a self-hostable, open-core **Project Operations Platform (ProjOps)** — the institutional memory of an engineering project. Where every existing secrets manager organizes by environment (dev / staging / prod), Project Vault organizes by *project*: credentials, certificates, domains, services, payments, and documentation grouped under the natural unit of engineering responsibility.

This is not a UI reorganization. It is a different data model, a different RBAC model, and a different mental model.

---

## What Makes This Different

Every existing secrets manager organizes around a *storage location*. Project Vault organizes by *project* — like filing by project folder, not by cabinet. Operational metadata (certificate expiry, payment renewal dates, uptime monitoring, documentation, service relationships) does not exist in secrets managers at all. It requires a project-centric architecture designed from the ground up.

Key differentiators:

- **Project as the unit of truth** — credentials, services, certificates, documentation, and monitoring grouped under one project context, mirroring how engineers think and work
- **Open-core and independently auditable** — the full security engine is open source; trust is earned through transparency, not claimed
- **Plugin-based rotation with propagation** — when a credential rotates, Project Vault updates it in every connected system and confirms each update before the old credential is retired
- **Operational scope** — certificates, domains, payment dates, uptime, and documentation live alongside credentials because they are all part of keeping a project running
- **Self-hosted primary, SaaS optional** — data sovereignty is the default trust path
- **Compliance by design** — audit logs, RBAC, and versioning are structured to support SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 evidence collection from day one

## Implementation Status

Epic-by-epic status, current as of 2026-07-11 (source of truth:
[`sprint-status.yaml`](_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml)):

| Epic | Status | What ships |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Vault Foundation | ✅ Done | Docker deploy, health/readiness endpoints, password + TOTP MFA auth, JWT sessions with idle timeout and revocation, structured operational logging |
| 2. Secret & Credential Management | ✅ Done | Project-scoped credential CRUD + immutable version history, search/filter/tags, dependent-system records, expiry/rotation schedules, bulk import, onboarding wizard, cross-project search, web UI completeness pass (Story 2.9) |
| 3. Notification Infrastructure | ✅ Done | Email + Slack delivery, per-alert-type routing, in-app inbox (`/notifications`), credential-expiry notification delivery (3.5), and the closure story (3.4 — surface truth/MFA alerts/doc reconciliation) all done |
| 4. Team & Organization Management | ✅ Done | Invitations & role assignment, org user management, account deactivation/recovery, project archival, and the fine-grained permissions closure story (4.5 — per-project visibility gating, `read:secret_value`/`read:secret_metadata` split) all done |
| 5. Credential Rotation | ✅ Done | Rotation initiation + checklist, stale-recovery, break-glass emergency rotation, full rotation web UI, hardening/tech-debt closure |
| 6. Operational Monitoring & Status | ✅ Done | Service/certificate/domain records, HTTP endpoint monitoring & alerts, cross-project health dashboard, public status pages, full monitored-asset web UI |
| 7. Machine User Access & CI/CD | ✅ Done | Machine user identities, API keys, offline fallback cache, GitHub Actions integration, and the machine-user management web UI (Story 8.6) all shipped; retroactive hardening review (Story 8.8) done |
| 8. Compliance, Audit & Governance | ✅ Done | Tamper-evident HMAC audit log, search/export/external forwarding, access reports, dormant-user detection, GDPR erasure, and the full audit/compliance web UI (Story 8.7) all shipped |
| 9. Platform Operations, API & Self-Hosting | ✅ Done | Encrypted backup/restore (9.1), system settings/multi-org/resource monitoring (9.2), in-place upgrades + real OpenAPI generation (9.3), the platform operator audit log (9.4), the operational runbook (9.5), backup/restore hardening (9.6), the platform-operations admin web UI (Story 9.7 — `/platform` backups, settings, orgs, resource usage, upgrade/API-docs, and platform audit log pages), and platform-admin MFA-gap/audit-bypass hardening (9.8) are all done |
| 10. Quality & Test Automation | 🟡 In progress | New epic added 2026-07-09 from a deferred-work reconciliation pass (no epic-10 section in the original PRD/epics doc). Playwright E2E test automation (10.1), `apps/web` branch coverage hardening (10.2), and the complete-source branch coverage buffer (10.3) are done; SonarCloud new-code coverage buffer (10.4) is ready for dev |

Known v1 design gaps, disclosed up front rather than discovered later:
- `vault_state.key_rotated_at` exists but no rotation-execution code path updates it yet (Story 9.2 / 9.5).
- No live backup-job progress polling and no in-app "click to upgrade" trigger in the Platform Admin UI — both are deliberate, documented v1 scope boundaries (Story 9.7 D3/D4); self-hosted in-place upgrades remain an out-of-band `docker compose up -d` operation.

## Open-Core Model

Project Vault is **free and open source** under the AGPL-3.0 license. The core — secrets storage, versioning, RBAC, audit logs, encryption at rest, plugin interface, manual rotation, and monitoring — will always be open.

A commercial **SaaS tier** is planned for v2, adding managed hosting, enterprise SSO, and compliance reporting. Self-hosted deployments remain free.

---

## Roadmap

| Version | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **v1 (GA)** | Self-hosted Docker, full secrets lifecycle, manual rotation, monitoring, teams, notifications, machine users, audit logs, backup, in-place upgrades | Epics 1–9 all fully done; Epic 10 (test automation/coverage hardening) added mid-stream and in progress |
| **v1.1** | Webhooks, project wiki | Not started |
| **v2** | Commercial SaaS tier, automated provider plugins (AWS, GCP, Azure, databases), enterprise SSO, compliance reporting | Not started |

See [Implementation Status](#implementation-status) above for the current epic-by-epic breakdown.

## Getting Started

**Operator guide:** **[docs/operator-quickstart.md](docs/operator-quickstart.md)** — zero → eval-ready (`make bootstrap`, database roles, vault ceremony, troubleshooting).

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| Local dev (hot reload) | `make bootstrap` then `pnpm turbo dev` — [Path A](docs/operator-quickstart.md#path-a--local-dev-fastest-for-ui-work) |
| Full Docker stack | `make bootstrap-docker` — [Path B](docs/operator-quickstart.md#path-b--full-docker-stack) |
| All make targets | `make help` |

### Minimum Tooling Versions

| Tool | Minimum Version |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 24 LTS |
| pnpm | 9.x or later |
| Docker | 24+ with Buildx |
| Docker Compose | v2 |

**Supported platforms:** macOS and Linux natively. Windows requires WSL2.

### Docker Quickstart

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make bootstrap-docker
```

Optional vault init/unseal via API (requires `jq`):

```bash
export VAULT_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
export VAULT_DEV_PASSPHRASE='your-local-passphrase-min-12-chars'
make bootstrap-docker ARGS="--init-vault"
```

Vault init/unseal in the web UI, readiness states, and troubleshooting: **[docs/operator-quickstart.md](docs/operator-quickstart.md)**.

Manual equivalent: `docker compose up --build -d`

Services:
- Web: http://localhost:5173
- API: http://localhost:3000
- API health: http://localhost:3000/health

### Local dev (API + web, hot reload)

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env          # optional for local eval; defaults work with make bootstrap

make bootstrap                # Postgres + migrate + RLS check

export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://vault_app:dev-only-change-in-prod@localhost:5432/project_vault
export VAULT_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
export VAULT_ALLOW_REMOTE_INIT=true   # local dev only — never in production
pnpm turbo dev
```

Restart `pnpm turbo dev` after changing vault operator exports. Turbo passes them via `globalPassThroughEnv` in `turbo.json` (`VAULT_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`, `VAULT_ENVELOPE_KEY_HALF`, `VAULT_ALLOW_REMOTE_INIT`).

Open http://localhost:5173:

1. **Initialize vault** (if uninitialized) — Passphrase mode, paste `VAULT_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`, choose a passphrase for unseal.
2. **Unseal vault** (if sealed) — same passphrase.
3. **Register** the first user, then **sign in** (registration does not auto-login).
4. Use the shell: projects, credentials, import, onboarding, global search, rotations, monitored
   services/certificates/domains, machine users, cross-project health (`/health`), notifications
   inbox, team/user settings (`/settings`, including audit/compliance tooling). The very first user
   registered on the instance is auto-flagged as the **platform operator** and additionally sees a
   **Platform Admin** nav item (`/platform`) for instance-wide backup/restore, system settings,
   multi-org provisioning, resource-usage monitoring, version/upgrade info, and the platform
   operator audit log — invisible to every other user.

API-only eval: same vault steps, then use `curl` against http://localhost:3000 — see [Auth Configuration](#auth-configuration) below.

### Local Development

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
make bootstrap                # preferred — see docs/operator-quickstart.md
```

The repo uses **two** PostgreSQL roles (details in the [operator quickstart](docs/operator-quickstart.md#two-database-roles-read-this-first)):

| Role | Used for | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `postgres` (superuser) | migrations only (`make db-migrate`) | creates `vault_app`, RLS policies, triggers |
| `vault_app` | app, tests, `check-rls`, `turbo dev` | superuser **bypasses RLS** — false-green tests if misused |

`make bootstrap` runs migrate + `check-rls` with the correct roles. Individual targets when you need them:

```bash
make db-up          # Postgres container only
make db-migrate     # superuser migrations
make check-rls      # vault_app RLS coverage
make test           # test suite as vault_app
make dev            # pnpm turbo dev (export DATABASE_URL first)
```

`turbo.json` passes `DATABASE_URL` via `globalEnv` once exported. **Nothing auto-loads `.env`** for turbo tasks — export vars in your shell or use the Makefile targets that set `DATABASE_URL` for you.

### Auth Configuration

Story 1.6 adds password registration and cookie-based sessions. Local development can use the defaults in `.env.example`; production must replace every HMAC/session secret with a distinct 32+ byte random value (10 total — see "Production hardening" in [docs/operator-quickstart.md](docs/operator-quickstart.md) for the full list):

```bash
SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
REFRESH_TOKEN_HMAC_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

Key auth settings:

| Variable | Local default | Production note |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_REGISTRATION_ENABLED` | `true` | Set `false` for invite-only deployments |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` | Set `true` behind HTTPS/Traefik so browsers persist auth cookies |
| `TRUST_PROXY` / `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` | `false` / `1` | Enable only behind a trusted reverse proxy |
| `JWT_ACCESS_TTL_SECONDS` | `300` | Access cookie lifetime |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL_DAYS` | `7` | Refresh cookie lifetime |

Example auth flow after the vault is initialized and unsealed:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"owner@acme.example","password":"correct-horse-battery-staple","orgName":"Acme Corp"}' | jq .

curl -s -c cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"owner@acme.example","password":"correct-horse-battery-staple"}' | jq .

curl -s -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/refresh | jq .
```

Rotating `SESSION_SECRET` invalidates access JWTs. Rotating `REFRESH_TOKEN_HMAC_SECRET` invalidates all refresh tokens and forces users to log in again.

A [`Makefile`](./Makefile) wraps DB roles, bootstrap, quality gates, and Docker:

```bash
make help             # list all targets
make bootstrap        # Postgres + migrate + RLS (local dev entry point)
make bootstrap-docker # full compose stack
make db-up            # Postgres container only
make db-migrate       # migrations as postgres
make test             # tests as vault_app
make check-rls        # RLS coverage as vault_app
make ci               # full local quality-gate sequence
make docker-up        # build + start full stack (manual compose)
make docker-smoke     # end-to-end /health + /ready check
```

Full operator flows: **[docs/operator-quickstart.md](docs/operator-quickstart.md)**.

### CI Quality Gates

Each gate runs on every PR:

| Gate | Command | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | `pnpm turbo typecheck` | strict TS, noUncheckedIndexedAccess |
| Lint | `pnpm turbo lint` | ESLint flat config with security rules |
| Tests | `pnpm turbo test` (as `vault_app`) | Vitest with ≥80% coverage |
| Duplication | `pnpm jscpd` | Zero code duplication |
| Secrets | ESLint no-secrets | Entropy-based secret detection |
| Audit | `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` | Zero high/critical CVEs |
| Docker | CI only | Multi-arch build validation |

Nightly gates (runs at 02:00 UTC):
- **Mutation testing** (Stryker) — score ≥60% (target ≥80%; ratchet per project policy)
- **Docker image scan** (Trivy) — zero high/critical CVEs

### Pre-PR Checklist

Requires Postgres on `localhost:5432` (`make db-up` or `make bootstrap` first).

```bash
make ci              # typecheck, lint, migrate, RLS check, test, jscpd, audit, spec freshness
make docker-smoke    # end-to-end Docker health check
```

Equivalent without `make`:

```bash
pnpm turbo typecheck lint
make db-migrate check-rls
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://vault_app:dev-only-change-in-prod@localhost:5432/project_vault pnpm turbo test
pnpm jscpd
pnpm docker:smoke
```

### Base Image Update Procedure

Run `scripts/update-base-image.sh` weekly to get fresh digests for pinned Docker base images. Update the `FROM` lines in Dockerfiles with the output digest. Document quarterly in the operations checklist.

### Production Usage

```bash
make docker-prod
# equivalent:
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Production hardening checklist: [docs/operator-quickstart.md — Production hardening](docs/operator-quickstart.md#production-hardening-before-non-dev-deploy).

---

## Operations

Running a self-hosted instance day-to-day, after the first deploy: **[docs/runbook.md](docs/runbook.md)** — vault lifecycle (unseal/reseal), in-place upgrades, encrypted backup & restore, master key management, incident response, Prometheus monitoring, and the quarterly operations checklist.

---

## Contributing

The codebase is live and under active development (see [Implementation Status](#implementation-status)), but the project isn't yet accepting external code contributions. Until then, the best way to contribute is:

- ⭐ **Star this repository** to signal interest and help with OSS discovery
- 🐛 **Open issues** for feature requests, use cases, or questions — early input shapes the roadmap
- 💬 **Start a discussion** if you have ideas about the plugin interface, RBAC model, or integration patterns
- 📖 **Review the planning artifacts** in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/` — the PRD, UX spec, and architecture docs are open, as are the in-progress story files and retrospectives in `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/`

Once external contributions open, a `CONTRIBUTING.md` will cover:
- Development environment setup
- Code style and conventions
- Security-sensitive code path requirements
- Plugin development guide
- PR review process

---

## Security

Project Vault handles credentials, certificates, and sensitive operational data. Security is a first-class architectural concern, not a feature layer.

- All secrets encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
- TLS 1.3 required for all inbound connections
- Constant-time comparisons for all secret/token operations; memory zeroing after secret use
- Secret values must never appear in logs, stack traces, or error messages
- Full security model documented in architecture artifacts

To report a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**. Contact details will be published in a `SECURITY.md` at launch.
